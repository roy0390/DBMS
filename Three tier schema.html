    <h2><u>Three tier schema architecture for data independence :</u></h2>
    <p>
        The 3-tier archeticture is a commonly used architectural approach in database management
        system(DBMS) for the design and <br>development of applications that work with databases.
        <br>
        The 3-tier archeticture divides an application's components into three tiers or layers. Each
        layer has its own set of responsibilites.<br>
        DBMS 3-Tier architecture divides the complete system into three inter related 
        but independent modules as shown below:

        <b>Physical Level :</b> At the Physical level, the information about the location if database objects
        in the data store is kept. Various usersof DBMS are unaeare of the locations of These objects.
        In simple terms, physical level of a database describes how the data is being stored in secondary
        storage devices like disks and tapes and also gives insights on additional storage details. 
     </p>
     <p>
        <b>Conceptual Level :</b> At conceptual level, data is represented in the form of various database tables.
        For Example, STUDENT database may contain STUDENT and COURSE tables which will be visible to users are unaware
        of their storage.Also referred as logical schema, it describes what kind of data is to be stored in the database.
     </p>
     <p>
        <b>External Level :</b> An external level specifies a view of the data in terms of conceptual level
        tables. Each external level view is used to cater to the needs of a particular category of
        users. For example, FACULTY of a university is intreseted in looking course details of students; 
        STUDENTS are interested in looking at all details related to academics,accounts,courses and 
        hostel details as well. So, different views can be generated for different users.
        The main focus of external level is data abstraction.
