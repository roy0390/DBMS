    <h2>2.0 FILE SYSTEMS V/S A DBMS </h2>


    <P>To understand the need for a DBMS, let us consider a motivating scenario: A 
        company has a large collection of data on employees, departments, products, sales,
        and so on. This data is accessed concurrently by several employees. Questions about
        the data must be answered quickly, changes made to the data by different users must be
        applied consistently, and access to certain parts of the data(e.g., salaries) msust be restricted.

    </P>
    <p>
        We can try to manage the data by storing it in operting system files. This approach has many 
        drawbacks,including the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                We probably do not have 500 GB of main memory to hold all the data.
                We must therefore store the data in storage device such as a disk or tape and 
                bring relevant parts of the data into main  memory for processing as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Even if we have 500 GB of main memory, on computer systems with 32-bit
                addressing, we cannot refer directly to more than 4 GB of data. We have
                to program some method of identifying all data items.
            </li>
            <li>
                We have to write special programs to answer each Question a user may want
                to ask about the data. These programs are likely to be complex because of
                the large volume of data to be searched.
            </li>
            <li>
                We have to write special programs to update the data. These programs must
                ensure that the data is updated consistently, even if several users are
                updating the data at the same time.

            </li>
            <li>
                We must ensure that data is restored to a consistent state if the system
                crashes while changes are being made.
            </li>
            <li>
                Operting systems provide only a password mechanism for security. This is 
                not sufficiently flexible to enforce security polices in which different users
                have permission to access different subsets of the data.
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        A DBMS is a piece of software designed to make the preceding tasks easier. By
        storing data in a DBMS rather than as a collection of operating system files,
        we can use the DBMS's features to manage the data in a robust and efficient
        manner. As the volume of data and the number of users grow-hundreds of gigabytes
        of data and thousands of users are commom in current corporate databases--DBMS support becomes
        indispensable.
