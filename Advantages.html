    <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Advantages of a DBMS</h1>
    <p>Using a DBMS to manage data has many advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data independence:</b> <p>
            Applications programs should not, ideally, be exposed to details of data representation and storage.
            The DBMS provides an abstract view of the data that hides such details.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <b>Efficient data access:</b> <p>
                A DBMS utilizes a variety of sophisticated techniques to store and retrieve data efficiently.
                This feature is especially important if the data is stored on esternal storage devices.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Data integrity and security:
            </b> <p>
                If data is always accessed through the DBMS, the DBMS can enforce integrity constraints.
                For example, before inserting salary information for an employee, the DBMS can check that
                the department budget is not exceeded. Also, it can enforce access controls that govern what 
                data is visible to different classes of users.
            </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Data Administration:
            </b><P>
                When several users share the data, centralizing the administration of data can offer significant
                improvements. Experienced professionals who understand the nature of the data being managed, and
                how different groups of users use it, can be redundancy and for fine-tuning the storage of the data to make 
                retrival efficient.
            </P>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Concurrent Access and Crash Recovery:
            </b> <p>
                A DBMS schedules concurrent access to the data in such a manner that users can think of the
                data as being accessed by only one user at a time. Further, the DBMS protects users from
                the effects of system failures.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Reduced Application Development Time:
            </b> <p>
                Clearly, the DBMS supports important functions that are common to many applications accessing 
                data in the DBMS. This, in conjuction with the high level interface to the data, facilitates
                quick application development. DBMS applications are also likely to be more robust than similar
                stand-alone applications because many important tasks are handled by the DBMS(and do not have to be debugged and tested in the application).
            </p>
        </li>
       
        <li><b>Data Sharing :</b> Multiple users can access and update the same data
             simultaneously.</li>
             <li><b>Data Consistency :</b> Enforcing data integrity rules prevents inconsistencies and 
            ensures data accuracy.</li>
    <li><b>Efficient Data Retrieval:</b> Queries can be used to quickly retrieve specific data based 
    on complexity criteria.</li>
    <li><u>Security :</u> Access controls and encryption mechanisms can be implemented to protect 
    senstive data.</li>
    <li><u>Scalability :</u> Database can be easily expanded to accommodate large volumes of data.</li>

    </ul>
