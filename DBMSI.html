                A database is a collection of data, typically describing the activities of one or more
                related organizations. A database is used to store and retrieve data from a computer.
                A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that uses a standard method 
                to store and organize data. The data can be added, updated, deleted, or traversed using
                various standard algorithms and queries.
                For example, a university database might contain information about the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Entities such as students, faculty, courses, and classrooms.</li>
                    <li>Relationships between entities, such as students enrollment in courses,
                        faculty teaching courses, and the use of rooms for courses.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
              <li> A <b>database management system,</b> or <b>DBMS</b>, is software designed to assist in 
                maintaining and utilizing large collections of data. The need for such systems, as well as
                their use, is growing rapidly. The alternative to using a DBMS is to store the data in files
                and write application-specific code to manage it. The use of a DBMS has several important Advantages
                , as we will see in this chapter.</li>
